# pyprogeny
A method to estimate the optimal number of clusters in a dataset.

It is based on the [algorithm described](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep12894) in **Progeny Clustering: A method to Identify Biological Phenotypes**

It's also largely based on the prior [R implementation](https://github.com/baasman/pyprogeny/blob/master/pyprogeny.py), but with a cleaner, 'sci-kit learn' like interface.

It's still under development, and should not be trusted under any circumstances.
